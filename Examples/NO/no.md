The videos shows the different stages of the selection process made by CEREAL using the parallax and proper motions of the sample obtened from Gaia DR2.
The peaks in the parallax and proper motion were expected to be found around the known values of those parameters.

The difference between the stars classified as yes and the ones classified as no were more evident.
In these figures it can be observed from  the distribution of the histograms, it is not clear where the peak in the parameter is located,
due to the large number of sources that does not share the same properties as the target, or because the Herbig Ae/Be stars are too 
bright that they masking the low mass companions around them.  Additionally, their density profiles could show similar densities 
around the centre of the stars that then appeared constant over the whole distance. The spatial and proper motion distributions might not
show a clear group of stars that shared the same parallax as the Herbig Ae/Be star.
