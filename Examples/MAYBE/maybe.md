The videos shows the different stages of the selection process made by CEREAL using the parallax and proper motions 
of the sample obtened from Gaia DR2.
The peaks in the parallax and proper motion were expected to be found around the known values of those parameters.

The differences in the classification between the yes and the maybe are very subtle. 
The difference in the classification is based principally on the histogram distributions and the density profile. 


In this case, at least two of the three histograms appear evenly distributed around the known value. 
Also, the histograms might have the peak shifted from the known value in one of the parameters, or the peak is not clearly defined.
Additionally, their density profile might not show a smooth decrease in the density as function of the distance and might not become 
completely flat at longer distances. In this case it is possible to see, in the spatial and proper motion distributions, 
around the Herbig Ae/Be star a group of stars that shared similar parallax values.
