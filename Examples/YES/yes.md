In each figure on the videos it can be observed that the distribution of the parallax and the proper motions appear evenly distributed around the known value. 
Whilst the density profile showed a smooth decrease in the density as a function of the distance. Also, the spatial and proper motion distributions 
showed that the companions around the Herbig Ae/Be star shared similar parallax values.
