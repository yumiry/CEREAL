# CEREAL
ClustER detEction ALgorithm using Gaia data

This code was created to calculate the clustering properties of the stars, 
specifically, the Herbig Ae/Be stars, using data from Gaia DR2. 

The clustering properties are found analyzing the distributions of the parallax and proper motions in RA and DEC.
It is important, but not necessary, to know the parallax and proper motions in RA and DEC of the Herbig Ae/Be star 
because those ones would be used to make the selection of the data. 

CEREAL was created as part of the STARYY project (STARs that ‘R’ Young: When do stars form in clustered environments?). 
This project has received funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under 
MSCA ITN-EID grant agreement No 676036.
