# CEREAL
ClustER detEction ALgorithm using Gaia data

This code was created to calculate the clustering properties of stars; 
specifically, Herbig Ae/Be stars, using data from Gaia DR2. 

The clustering properties are found by analyzing the distributions of the parallax, and proper motions in RA and DEC.
It is important to know the parallax, and proper motions in RA and DEC of the Herbig Ae/Be star as these properties can 
be used in the selection of data; However, it is not required to know this information as selections can be made by eye. 

CEREAL was created as part of the STARYY project (STARs that ‘R’ Young: When do stars form in clustered environments?). 
This project has received funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under 
MSCA ITN-EID grant agreement No 676036.
